 I told you, stop flying in the house! - Hey, Adam. - Hey, Barry. - Is that fuzz gel? - A little. Special
 day, graduation. Never thought I'd make it.
 Three days grade school, three days high school. Those were
awkward. Three days college. I'm glad I took
 a day and hitchhiked around the hive. You did come back
 different. - Hi, Barry. - Artie, growing a
  mustache? Looks good. - Hear about Frankie? - Yeah. - You
 going to the funeral? - No, I'm not going. E
 verybody knows, sting someone, you die. Don't waste it on
 a squirrel. Such a hothead. I guess he could have just gotten out of the way. I love this incorporating
 an amusement park into our day. That's why
 we don't need vacations. Boy, quite a bit of pomp... under
 the circumstances. - Well, Adam, today we
 are men. - We are! - Bee-men. - Amen! Hallelujah! Students,
 faculty, distinguished bees, please welcome
  Dean Buzzwell. Welcome, New Hive City graduating

 . Can anyone work on the Krelman? Of course. Most bee jobs
 are small ones. But bees know that every
  small job, if it's done well, means a lot. But choose
 carefully because you'll stay in the job y
 ou pick for the rest of your life. The same job the rest
 of your life? I didn't know that. What's the
 difference? You'll be happy to know that bees, as a
 species, haven't had one day off in 27 million
  years. So you'll just work us to death? We'll
 sure try. Wow! That blew my mind! "What's the difference?" How can you say that? One job forever?
 That's an insane choice to have to make. I'm relieved. Now we only have to make one decision in
 life. But, Adam, how could they never have told
  us that? Why would you question anything? We're
 bees. We're the most perfectly functioning society on Earth. You ever think maybe things work a
